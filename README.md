# SemCache

> Save pages offline and share them on a local network.

## Overview

SemCache allows you to save webpages offline and share them on a local network.
When you are connected to the internet, use SemCache to download pages that you
want to access offline. When you do not have an internet connection, you will
be able to visit the saved (or 'cached') versions of these pages. What's more,
other SemCache users on the same network can browse the pages you have cached.

The purpose of SemCache is to leverage the networks that often exist between
devices even if the external connection to the internet is down or is
unreliable. Maybe a teacher travels to a city on the weekend, caches a bunch of
educational webpages, and wants to share the content with their students during
the week after they return to the village. Maybe someone visits a remote
village and has the latest sports scores saved on their computer. Maybe someone
caches a large percentage of Wikipedia on a dedicated machine in their village.
Or maybe you're just on a crummy connection at an airport and are desperate for
something to read.

SemCache makes this easy. Install the extension and get browsing without barely
any configuration.
